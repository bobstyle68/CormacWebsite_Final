            <h1>Here is a sample beginning to a DnD campaign.</h1>
            <p>You wake to find yourself in pitch black darkness. You feel disoriented and have know recollection as to how you got here. Around you you hear wind, the rustling of leaves... and panicked breathing. As your eyes adjust to the darkness you begin to see your surroundings a bit clearer. You are in a forest, which is peculiar considering last you remembered you were in a desert city living the life of a petty thief. Around you are other people, an elf, a dwarf, an orc and a dragonborn, quite an odd mix of individuals. They seem just as confused as you are. </p>
                
                
                
            <p>You decide to speak up, as everyone else seems to be too shocked to do so. As you get up to speak everyone flinches and reaches for their weapons. You raise your hands to show that you are unarmed and mean no harm. You ask them if they have any idea whats going on. They all come out with similar stories to your own. As you are looking at them you realise that every one of them is in armor and seem to constantly have their hands on their weapons, just like you... you are all warriors. You decide to take the lead and suggest that you should all survey the area. You survey the area and through a stroke of luck manage to notice a faint light in the distance. You all decide to approach it </p>
                
            <p>As you approch the light you realise that its the lights of a village, relief flows through you. As you enter the village the locals begin to stop and stare at your peculiar group. The group decide what they need the most right now is information, and the best place to find information is a tavern, it will also provide accomodation for the night. As your group enter the tavern it falls silent, everybody in the tavern are staring at the group. Just from that reaction you can tell that they are not used to seing all these different races of creatures, let alone you, a human travelling with them. You approach the barman and ask for information on where you are. You find out you are on the deep continent. As soon as he says that name your blood freezes. You have heard of the deep continent before, it was a place where countries used to dump all of their most dangerous criminals, but about 20 years ago there was a terrible magic disaster that ended up sinking most of the continent about 2 miles under ground, so the whole continent is basically a massive basin. As this reality dawns on the group you begin to realise just how dangerouse your situation is, somehow you and your companions were teleported to the deep continent.</p>
